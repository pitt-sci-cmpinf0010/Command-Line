# Readme

If you have questions about this week's lab ANY TA for this class can help you with any problems.

## Today: The Command Line!

Today's lesson takes a departure from your usual self-guided reading/doing/struggling. Instead, I'll be talking at you for a while because this stuff can get real confusing. We're going to cover what you need to know in order to use the command line effectively.

This lecture is based on your readings for the week:
* [Tracy Osborn, *Really Friendly Command Line Intro*](https://hellowebbooks.com/learn-command-line/#cmd-tut)
* [Software Carpentry, *The Shell*](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)
* Optional: [Neal Stephenson, *In the Beginning was the Command Line*](http://cristal.inria.fr/~weis/info/commandline.html)

## Getting Started Againâ„¢

1. Log into SCI JupyterHub and start a terminal
2. Type in `git clone https://github.com/pitt-sci-cmpinf0010/Command-Line.git` and hit the enter key
3. This should download a folder to your JupyterHub with the lab (it should be called `Command-Line`)
4. Double click the new folder in the file explorer. You should see the lab contents.
5. Launch the `Lab-Lesson.ipynb` notebook to review the lesson

### If JupyterHub doesn't work for you

Use Binder!

_**Important**:_ Binder does **not** always save your work. If you need to stop working on your lab for more than 30 minutes, you need to **download** your exercises notebook to you computer. Then, you can reupload it again later to continue your work.

## Submitting your finished lab

This week you get a little bit of a break. There are some exercises for you to complete in class to get more familiar with the command line; however, you don't need to submit these exercises. Instead, make yourself a GitHub account in order to prepare for next week's lab. Get the URL to your profile, and submit it to Canvas.

#### How to sign up for GitHub:
 * Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
 * Follow the instructions to create an account
     * name your account something you don't mind sharing with future employers
 * Don't forget to email-verify your account and/or set up 2 factor authentication (if you want).
 * Submit the URL for your profile on Canvas. This [quora page](https://www.quora.com/How-could-I-copy-my-GitHub-profile-URL) has instructions if you are having trouble finding the URL for your profile.
 * You're done!
