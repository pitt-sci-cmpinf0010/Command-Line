## Office hours

If you have questions about this week's lab, reading, or lecture, ANY TA for this class can help you with any problems. That being said, only email YOUR TA! Office hours are on Discord and Zoom. If none of the times for for you, please don't hesitate to reach out via email to set up another time.

## Today: The Command Line!

Today's lesson takes a departure from your usual self-guided reading/doing/struggling. Instead, I'll be talking at you for a while because this stuff can get real confusing. We're going to cover what you need to know in order to use the command line effectively.

This lecture is based on your readings for the week:
* [Tracy Osborn, *Really Friendly Command Line Intro*](https://hellowebbooks.com/learn-command-line/#cmd-tut)
* [Software Carpentry, *The Shell*](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)
* Optional: [Neal Stephenson, *In the Beginning was the Command Line*](http://cristal.inria.fr/~weis/info/commandline.html)

## Getting Started Againâ„¢

1. Open Jupyter Lab and start a terminal
2. Navigate to the folder you wish to download this lab
3. Type in git clone https://github.com/pitt-sci-cmpinf0010/lab-4.git and hit the enter key
4. This should download a folder to your local machine with the lab (it should be called lab-4)
5. Launch the desired notebook

### If JupyterHub doesn't work for you

Use Binder!

_**Important**:_ Binder does **not** always save your work. If you need to stop working on your lab for more than 30 minutes, you need to **download** your exercises notebook to you computer. Then, you can reupload it again later to continue your work.

Click this button to get started with Binder:

## Submitting your finished lab

Just kidding, there is no lab!

Instead, go ahead and make yourself a GitHub account in order to prepare for next week's lab.

#### How to sign up for GitHub:
 * Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
 * Follow the instructions to create an account
     * use your Pitt email to create an account
     * name your account something you don't mind sharing with future employers
 * Don't forget to email-verify your account and/or set up 2 factor authentication (if you want).
 * You're done!
