## Today: The Command Line!

Today's lesson takes a departure from your usual self-guided reading/doing/struggling. Instead, I'll be talking at you for a while because this stuff can get real confusing. We're going to cover what you need to know in order to use the command line effectively.

This lecture is based on your readings for the week:
* [Tracy Osborn, *Really Friendly Command Line Intro*](https://hellowebbooks.com/learn-command-line/#cmd-tut)
* [Software Carpentry, *The Shell*](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)
* Optional: [Neal Stephenson, *In the Beginning was the Command Line*](http://cristal.inria.fr/~weis/info/commandline.html)

## Getting Started Againâ„¢

1. In Canvas (canvas.pitt.edu), click on this class, CMPINF0010
2. Go to Modules
5. Click `Skills Lab Week 5` and click where is says `Click Here!`
6. JupyterHub should open up to this week's materials!

### If JupyterHub doesn't work for you

Use Binder!

_**Important**:_ Binder does **not** always save your work. If you need to stop working on your lab for more than 30 minutes, you need to **download** your exercises notebook to you computer. Then, you can reupload it again later to continue your work.

Click this button to get started with Binder:
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pitt-sci-cmpinf0010/week-5/master?urlpath=lab)

## Submitting your finished lab

Just kidding, there is no lab!

Instead, go ahead and make yourself a GitHub account in order to prepare for next week's lab.

#### How to sign up for GitHub:
 * Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
 * Follow the instructions to create an account
     * use your Pitt email to create an account
     * name your account something you don't mind sharing with future employers
 * Don't forget to email-verify your account and/or set up 2 factor authentication (if you want).
 * You're done!
